- [VectorMultiply1](https://github.com/BahaaKaaki/CUDA/blob/master/VectorMultiply1.cu) : This code performs element-wise vector multiplication
- [VectorMultiply2](https://github.com/BahaaKaaki/CUDA/blob/master/VectorMultiply2.cu) : This code performs element-wise vector multiplication where each thread calculated two elements of the output vector 
- [ColorToGrayscale](https://github.com/BahaaKaaki/CUDA/blob/master/ColorToGrayScale.cu) :  This code uses OpenCV libraries, which is an Open Source Computer Vision Library, to read the input color image and then display the resulting Grayscale image. 
You need to include both property sheets for both debug and release : [DebugPropertySheet.props](https://github.com/BahaaKaaki/CUDA/blob/master/DebugPropertySheet.props) & [PropertySheetRelease.props](https://github.com/BahaaKaaki/CUDA/blob/master/PropertySheetRelease.props).
